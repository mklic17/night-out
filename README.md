## The Night Out

For my Senior Project at DePauw University I created a Full Stack application that would allow users to discover ideas of what to do with friends, family, a partner, and by yourself. In order to find specific events that is in-line with the users wants, they can specify a price, age, and location to find better ideas. Users are able to submit things that they have done in order for others to be able to find more opportunities.

> **NOTE:**  This application has multiple counterparts. This current repository is the Firebase version, there is an accompanying MongoDB version that has a [Front-end](https://github.com/mklic17/night-out-mongo) and [Back-end](https://github.com/mklic17/the-night-out-server). 




## Technical Overview

* [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Getting Started

> The Night Out uses NPM to manage development dependencies, so install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if necessary

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm install`.

```shell
$ git clone <this repository>
$ cd <this project folder>
$ npm start
```

This will install dependencies and start a web server on port 8000.
